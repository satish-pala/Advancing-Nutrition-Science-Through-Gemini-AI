# Advancing Nutrition Science Through Gemini AI
This project aims to develop an AI-powered intelligent nutrition system using Gemini AI to provide personalized dietary analysis, nutrient tracking, and health recommendations. The solution integrates generative AI with structured nutritional datasets to deliver accurate, contextual, and user-specific dietary insights

The final system is designed as a web or mobile-based application where users can input meals (text or images) and receive real-time nutritional analysis and personalized diet suggestions

Project Overview

- Advanced Nutrition Science through Gemini AI applies large language models and nutritional data processing techniques to:
- Analyze food consumption patterns
- Estimate macronutrient and micronutrient intake
- Detect nutritional deficiencies
- Provide personalized diet plans
- Support weight management and lifestyle disease prevention

Project Objectives

- Build an AI-driven personalized nutrition assistanT 
- Integrate Gemini AI for contextual dietary understanding 
- Develop nutrient analysis based on food inputs
- Improve preventive healthcare using data-driven insights

Dataset

- USDA Food Composition Database 
- Nutritional value datasets (macronutrients and micronutrients)  
- Sample health profile datasets for validation

System Architecture

- User inputs food details or dietary preferences 
- Preprocessing module structures input data
- Gemini AI analyzes context and health goals 
- Nutritional database calculates macro/micronutrient values  
- AI generates personalized recommendations
- Output displayed via web or mobile interface   

Training Setup

If using ML components:
- Input data standardization 
- Nutritional value mapping 
- Prompt engineering for Gemini AI 
- Response validation and safety filtering  
Required libraries:
 pip install google-generativeai
 pip install streamlit
 pip install pandas
 pip install matplotlib

Results

- Personalized calorie estimation
- Macro and micronutrient breakdown
